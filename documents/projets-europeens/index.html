and prototype advanced interoperable XR solutions to solve common
challenges encountered by the industry (in areas such as assembly,
maintenance, remote operation, training, design, logistics, etc.),
placing the wellbeing of workers at the centre of the production
process. The platform will be populated with third party-projects
exploring a wide range of XR technologies and taking benefit of
other emerging technologies (such as 5G/6G, IoT, data, artificial
intelligence, edge and cloud computing, and microelectronics). In
order to facilitate the integration with existing IT systems and
policies, the EU XR platform for industry should prioritize XR
content, tools and solutions based on open standards, such as OpenXR
and WebXR. The solutions provided by the platform should aim to
cover as many industry ecosystems as possible. Involvement of
end-users is essential in defining specifications and testing.</p></li></ul><p>At least one proposal will be funded for the innovation type i.</p><p>Only one proposal will be funded for innovation type ii.</p><p><strong>Financial support to third parties</strong></p><p>The type ii innovation action will provide financial support third-party
projects from outstanding XR innovators, SMEs and other
multidisciplinary actors through a minimum of three open calls during

standardisation. These tasks cannot be implemented using the budget
earmarked for the financial support to third parties.</p><p>Proposals should make explicit the intervention logic for the area and
their potential to attract relevant top XR talents and to deliver a
solid value-added to the third-party projects. Proposals should also
prove the expertise and capacity of the consortium in managing the full
life-cycle of the open calls transparently and efficiently.</p><p>As support and mobilising of XR innovators is key to the type ii IA of
this topic, a minimum of 60% of the total requested EU contribution
should be allocated to financial support to the third parties.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals with an overall duration of
typically 36 months would allow these outcomes to be addressed

contribute to one of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul><li>Innovative AI solutions for trusted information production for media
professionals.</li></ul><p>Innovative AI solutions for supporting trustworthy online activity of
citizens.</p><p><strong>Scope</strong>: Following the results of the first HE work
programme, the second work programme will support innovation activities
to move closer to AI-based market and ultimately widely available
solutions that can play an important role in ensuring pluralistic access
to meaningful information, quality content and trustworthy online
interaction. This topic is fully in line with both the EDAP &ndash; European
Democracy Action Plan and MAAP &ndash; Media and Audiovisual Action Plan, for
reinforcing the European media ecosystem and maintaining resilient
democratic systems, in times of crises and of need for adaptation and
change.</p><p>Given the emergence of the next generation of social media as part of
digital universe(s) or fediverse(s), which are more immersive and based
on virtual realities and gaming contexts, the detection of different
forms of content manipulation (e.g. deep-fakes, tampered content and
scammed environments) becomes even more challenging. Solutions provided
would include the correlation/comparison of various sources of
information, multi-modal language interpretation, rapid visual pattern
detection in moving images and simulated environments, capabilities as
recommendation engine/personal companion, and interfacing with
augmented, virtual reality and gaming environments. Solutions should be
gender-sensitive and not perpetuate harmful stereotypes. The innovation
actions will bring together technological providers, media professionals
and end users for ensuring market readiness of the results.</p><p>Proposals should clearly identify the expected outcome it will focus on
(i.e. media professionals or citizens). All proposals are expected to
embed mechanisms to assess and demonstrate progress (with qualitative
and quantitative KPIs, demonstrators, benchmarking and progress
monitoring), and share communicable results with the European R&amp;D
community, through the AI-on-demand platform. Activities are expected to
achieve TRL6-7 by the end of the project.</p><p>All proposals are expected to allocate tasks to cohesion activities with
the other subtopic, the PPP on AI, Data and Robotics and funded actions
related to this partnership, and to extend and apply the results from
the previous research and innovation topic on AI against Disinformation.</p><h3 id=horizon-cl4-2023-human-01-82-art-driven-digital-innovation-towards-human-compatible-and-ecologically-conscious-technology-csa class=HeadingThree>HORIZON-CL4-2023-HUMAN-01-82: Art-driven digital innovation: Towards human compatible and ecologically conscious technology (CSA)</h3><table class="table table-striped table-bordered"><thead><tr><th>Specific conditions</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Expected EU contribution per project</td><td>The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 3.00 million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately.

regarding the role of the arts in R&amp;I in the spirit of a European
innovation policy based on culture and values. It is building on results
of the <a href=https://starts.eu/ target=_blank rel=noopener>S|T|ARTS program</a> that has
demonstrated concrete benefits of art-technology collaboration for
digital innovation and uptake of digital in society and economy.</p><ol><li>a. <em>Facilitate artistic experimentation with (digital)
technologies</em> to accelerate development and novel
use cases of digital technologies. The emphasise will be on
ecologically conscious and human compatible technologies and use
case of technologies.</li></ol><p>To this end, the consortium will fund (via FSTP in form of grants)
<em>S|T|ARTS residencies</em> of artists to be hosted by EC funded
projects, technology institutions, or SMEs/industrial actors (both
digital providers and end-users of digital). In the spirit of the topic,
hosts of residencies must provide access to technology free of cost. The
consortium will mentor residencies and help in follow-up/exploitation of
the outcomes (commercial or other). Non-exclusive examples of intended
outcomes include:</p><ul><li><p>Art-driven development and use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in
spirit of the EC communication on &lsquo;<em>Trustworthy AI&rsquo;</em></p></li><li><p>Art-driven applications of high-performance computing
(visualisation, simulation etc).</p></li><li><p>Art as a catalyst for uptake of the digital in society and economy
in the spirit of <a href=https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/edihs target=_blank rel=noopener>digital innovation
hubs</a>.</p></li><li><p>Art-driven use of technology to facilitate the Green Transition, in
the spirt of the &lsquo;<em>New European Bauhaus&rsquo;</em> (urban development, green
manufacturing, circular economy, etc.)</p></li><li><p>Art-driven use of digital media to fight disinformation, for example
to promote factual narratives and change behavior in context of
Green Transition and climate change.</p><p>a. <em>Continuation of the annual S|T|ARTS prize</em>: Achieve
visibility of successful art and technology collaborations via
an annual prize (FSTP in form of prizes) in two categories - to
be defined by proposers, organize annual calls (launch,
evaluation) and disseminate the prizes and its winners in an
award ceremony and an exhibition.</p><p>b. Organise an <em>annual S|T|ARTS Festival</em>. The festival
will highlight synergies of digital &ndash; in particular AI - with
human creativity in art and music. Artistic use of digital can
push limits of digital technology and is considered a measure of
compatibility of digital with human values and needs.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Scope</strong>: While Europe is strongly pushing innovation based
on technological and scientific progress, it has always put social and
ecological priorities on the same level as economic growth. This has led
to a new alliance of the arts with S&amp;T as part of a European innovation

following expected outcomes:</p><ul><li><p>Cultural heritage professionals in Europe, including curators,
conservators and researchers of cultural heritage, use a common set
of new innovative tools and methods for the digitisation and
visualisation of cultural heritage objects (3D and enhanced 2D) with
regard to their visible and non-visible properties and
characteristics, which are accessible through and connected to the
European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage (ECCCH).</p></li><li><p>The European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage (ECCCH)
provides cultural heritage institutions and professionals with
enhanced technological and methodological capabilities to study
cultural heritage objects, to share related data of their visible
and non-visible properties and characteristics, and to develop new
forms of collaboration.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Scope</strong>: This topic aims at designing and implementing
innovative tools and methods for digitisation of (a) visible
characteristics and (b) non-visible characteristics of cultural heritage
objects, to be incorporated into the European Collaborative Cloud for
Cultural Heritage (ECCCH).</p><p>As regards digitisation of visible characteristics of cultural heritage
objects, technologies are now satisfying the needs for a considerable
part of uses and objects. For instance, in the field of digital
documentation of cultural heritage, three-dimensional acquisition and
reconstruction methods have been developed in the past twenty years,
using photogrammetry and laser scanning techniques to capture the
characteristics of physical cultural heritage objects. Such methods
already provide robust solutions for the digital reconstruction of the
geometry and visual appearance of object surfaces. In addition to these
methods, in the field of cultural heritage conservation various
non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques have become important technical
and scientific means of examination. Such techniques allow understanding
the phenomena of deterioration and defining the restoration,
conservation and documentation needs of cultural heritage objects.</p><p>Nevertheless, there are still major needs in cultural heritage that
require further research and innovation on more advanced digitisation
tools and methods:</p><ul><li><p>New AI-powered tools and methods that improve the digitisation
process of tangible cultural heritage objects. The robustness and
efficiency of the 3D digitisation process should be improved,
especially in the case of massive digitisation (for example
collections of objects). The accuracy and completeness of surface
appearance acquisition should also be improved, as well as the
mapping of complex reflectance data on digital surfaces.
Furthermore, such solutions should yield new improved methods for
post-processing and cleaning of the 3D models produced.</p></li><li><p>Improved methods for acquiring and processing enhanced 2D
representations (e.g. reflectance transformation imaging,
multispectral, panoramic), and for better integrating 2D
representations with 3D representations.</p></li><li><p>Future 3D models need to encode other key attributes in addition to
the usual geometric and reflectance data, such as local uncertainty
information. New tools and methods are therefore needed to calculate
and encode local accuracy limits with high precision in
reconstructed 3D models. These tools should be capable of producing
measurement-based limits of the similarity between the digital model
and the physical object at any surface point, as well as
algorithmically estimated accuracy boundaries.</p></li><li><p>To model a complex assembly is a costly effort, and today often
requires dismounting the assembly - which is often not possible.
Specific digitisation solutions should be developed that are capable
of mixing various digitisation approaches (e.g. scanning and
computer tomography scans) in order to capture dynamic or hidden
characteristics of complex assemblies without dismounting them.<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup></p></li></ul><p>As regards the study of non-visible characteristics of complex objects,
nowadays different techniques are used, e.g. multispectral imaging,
X-rays, infrared reflectance, terahertz imaging, etc. Proposals should
focus on innovations at the data acquisition level, with a view to
improve the quality and usability of the data generated. An important
aspect is the robustness, reliability as well as the ease of use of any
tool and method for analysing the visible characteristics and
non-visible materials properties of cultural heritage objects under real
world conditions. In addition, several recent experimental approaches
have shown that multimodal analysis techniques should include a temporal
dimension, observing the evolution of features and phenomena over time.</p><p>These challenges highlight the need for flexible, transferable, and
simple solutions for documenting multimodal analyses. These solutions
should include the integration of data acquisitions from different
technologies into complex data structures that provide new analysis
opportunities for conservation scientists, conservators and curators.
This requires the introduction of new visualisation tools that act as
virtual environments for scientific exploration, allowing scientists and
curators to explore the full material complexity of cultural heritage
objects beyond what is visible.</p><p>Large datasets are often generated (e.g., many dozens of images in the
case of hyperspectral imaging). To address this, new AI solutions should
be developed to generate classified or pre-analysed data, enabling the
selection and/or identification of specific elements, images or regions
of interest that exhibit important differences for subsequent analysis
and validation by the human expert.</p><p>The tools and methods introduced should focus on geometric and
projective consistency of heterogeneous data from different
technologies, with respect to different scales of observation and
analysis, over a wide spectral range, to produce an integrated digital
representation. Spatially localised characterisation of individual
material layers is one of the goals, including coupling multi- or
hyperspectral analyses with physicochemical characterisation of
materials. New methods for access, exploration, and temporal monitoring
of acquired data should be developed, including their interactive
visualisation and classification.</p><p>The proposed software tools and methods to be developed should go beyond
the lab prototype status, should be practical and possible to deploy
easily in un-controlled environments (e.g. digitise in a museum room),
and should ensure low cost and flexibility of use. The component for
data integration into the ECCCH may extend the features of the basic
tool developed by the project funded under topic
HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01, with the goal of streamlining the
upload of metadata/paradata and of raw sampled data.</p><p>The proposals should demonstrate the potential of the developed tools
and methods through representative case studies, conducted in
collaboration with relevant stakeholders. These case studies should
cover a significant share of the range of cultural heritage objects,
materials and conservation/restoration issues. The results of these case
studies should produce emblematic data that can serve as models for
promoting the re-use of the tool(s) and methods in other contexts and by
other users within the ECCCH.</p><p>The proposed tool(s) to be developed should be implemented adopting the
low-level libraries established by the project funded under topic
HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. The tool(s) developed should be
compliant with the design of the ECCCH, and should be integrated with
the ECCCH before the end of the project, together with proper
documentation. All software and other related deliverables should be
compliant with the data model and the software development guidelines
elaborated by the project funded under topic
&lsquo;HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01&rsquo;.</p><p>The proposals should furthermore make provisions to actively participate
in the common activities of ECCCH initiative. In particular, the
proposals should coordinate technical work with other selected projects
and contribute to the activities of the project funded under the topic
HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01.</p><p>The proposals should set up its project website under the common ECCCH
website, managed by the project funded under topic
HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. The proposal is further expected
to include a budget for the attendance to regular joint coordination
meetings and may consider to cover the costs of any other joint
activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities

technologies (AI) is marked by great optimism and expectation, sometimes
followed by disappointment. However, we have recently seen a sustained
upsurge in interest and the successful uptake and application of AI in a
variety of significant areas such as drug discovery, autonomous
vehicles, social media, industrial robotics, and logistics, to name a
few. We have witnessed significant successes in the development and
deployment of machine learning, particularly for tasks normally
associated with human perception<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup>. We have also seen significant
successes in symbolic and logic-driven AI for problems that require
reasoning about constraints, automated reasoning, planning, etc.<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup> AI
has had significant impact in the arts and humanities, and AI-based
methods and tools are becoming more widely used in the cultural
arena.<sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup></p><p>Nevertheless, today the collection of computer technologies commonly
labelled artificial intelligence, along with related technologies for
instance in the fields of data science, neuroscience and biotechnology,
already show the potential to disrupt and impact the rights of
individuals and the wellbeing of societal structures. For example, there
have been many documented case studies where AI-based applications have
exhibited undesired gender and racial bias<sup id=fnref:6><a href=#fn:6 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>6</a></sup>. AI systems have been
(mis-)used to micro-target and influence voters in elections as well as
in the creation and dissemination of disinformation<sup id=fnref:7><a href=#fn:7 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>7</a></sup>, and otherwise
impact on human agency and autonomy. Many ethical issues arise in the
development of AI systems, such as their use in medical devices,
brain-computer interfaces, reasoning about human mental and emotion
state, etc.<sup id=fnref:8><a href=#fn:8 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>8</a></sup></p><p>Concerns are often raised that AI technologies may imply major societal
disruptions such as massive job displacements due to the increasing use
of AI-drive automation and robotics, while research show that AI can
also help filling gaps in workforce<sup id=fnref:9><a href=#fn:9 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>9</a></sup><sup id=fnref:10><a href=#fn:10 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>10</a></sup>.</p><p>In 2018, the European Commission established the High Level Expert Group
on Artificial Intelligence (HLEG-AI), which was tasked with developing a
set of ethics guidelines for Europe that would help ensure that AI
systems be human-centric and trustworthy. The importance of a
human-centric approach to AI has been a cornerstone of EU policy-making
in the field for several years and is the clearly articulated position
of the EU. The European Commission published a pioneering draft AI Act
in April 2021, the first legal framework on AI in Europe, which
addresses the potential risks of using AI<sup id=fnref:11><a href=#fn:11 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>11</a></sup>. The Horizon Europe work
programme under Cluster 4 is funding related research and innovation
actions under the header &lsquo;Leadership in AI based on trust&rsquo;.</p><p>The common principle across all of these EU initiatives are seven key
requirements for trustworthy AI<sup id=fnref:12><a href=#fn:12 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>12</a></sup>, as proposed by the HLEG-AI and
adopted by the European Commission, as well as the importance of
protecting the fundamental rights of individuals<sup id=fnref:13><a href=#fn:13 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>13</a></sup>.</p><p>Against this backdrop, before being faced with a &lsquo;fait-accompli&rsquo; in
terms of potentially undesirable influence of AI on the European society
and economy and to make sure that all the beneficial potential of AI
deployment is fully realised, we should anticipate and prepare for
possible and high impact scenarios.</p><p>The proposal should cover all the following aspects:</p><ul><li><p>Decisive contributions to develop a sound European capacity building
on the long term human and societal implications of AI, building, as
appropriate, on previous work of the HLEG-AI, ADRA<sup id=fnref:14><a href=#fn:14 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>14</a></sup>, or other
relevant European and national AI initiatives.</p></li><li><p>A solid scientific approach, providing an in-depth analysis of
successful existing deployment of AI and the impact they have on
European economy and society. Such analysis should also
significantly contribute to awareness raising of such deployments,
providing a reality check of capabilities/benefits, but also
limitations of current AI solutions, and how the latter are
currently addressed.</p></li><li><p>Scenario based analysis of future long term potential benefits to
citizens and societies, as well as an analysis of related challenges
and threats.</p></li><li><p>Based on this, proposals should elaborate a set of guiding
principles, ensuring a broad support and appropriate involvement of
other relevant AI initiatives.</p></li><li><p>Proposals need to take a multi-disciplinary and cross-sectorial
approach, and engage with a wide set of stakeholders, including
research organisations, enterprises, citizens<sup id=fnref:15><a href=#fn:15 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>15</a></sup>, policymakers,
public private partnerships such as the AI, Data and Robotics
Partnership, and other relevant EU projects and initiatives around
AI.</p></li><li><p>European policy actions should be proposed in a priority order,
notably in the area of research and innovation but not excluding
other important policy areas, that would serve to strengthen
European preparedness and resilience in the face of future
developments within AI and related emerging technologies as well as
to guide the development and deployment of these technologies in a
desirable direction.</p></li></ul><p>Proposals should build on existing knowledge, activities and networks,
such as the HLEG-AI and other initiatives funded by the European Union.

area, such as Excellence and trust in artificial intelligence under A
Europe fit for the digital age<sup id=fnref:16><a href=#fn:16 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>16</a></sup>. Furthermore, the proposals should
seek synergies with closely related actions, such as relevant R&amp;I

(forthcoming) legislation, in particular linked to the horizontal Act on
AI, the Liability Directive, and Machinery Directive/ Regulation.
Projects are encouraged - when reflecting on the effects of automation
and augmented reality - to dedicate particular attention to youth/
younger generation, women and persons with disabilities as well as to
the affordability of digital solutions. Projects are expected to develop
training material allowing the targeted end users and multipliers to
easily deploy and promote the new technologies.</p><p>Proposals must implement the &lsquo;multi-actor approach&rsquo; including a range of
actors to ensure that knowledge and needs from various stakeholder
groups, including farmers, farm workers, farm advisors and scientists
are taken into consideration. This topic should involve the effective
contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines.</p><p>Projects are expected to take into consideration the results of other
related Horizon 2020/ Europe projects as well as of other relevant
EU-funded projects and initiatives.<br>Proposals may involve financial support to third parties, e.g. to
academic researchers, hi-tech start-ups, SMEs, and other
multidisciplinary actors, to, for instance, develop, test or validate
developed approaches, tools and applications or to provide other
contributions to achieve the project objectives. A maximum of € 60 000
per third party might be granted. Conditions for third parties support
are set out in Part B of the General Annexes. Consortia need to define
the selection process of organisations, for which financial support may
be granted. Maximum 20% of the EU funding can be allocated to this
purpose. The financial support to third parties can only be provided in
the form of grants.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>The term industry in this context encompasses all ecosystems
