### 14h Accueil

### 14h10 Session ‚ÄúSensorielle‚Äù
#### 14h10 : Nebula: An Affordable Open-Source and Autonomous Olfactory Display for VR Headsets (Charles JAVERLIAT ‚Äì ECL/ENISE, LIRIS)

The impact of olfactory cues on user experience in virtual reality is increasingly studied.
However, results are still heterogeneous and existing studies difficult to replicate, mainly due
to a lack of standardized olfactory displays. In that context, we present Nebula, a low-cost,
open-source, olfactory display capable of diffusing scents at different diffusion rates using a
nebulization process. Nebula can be used with PC VR or autonomous head-mounted
displays, making it easily transportable without the need for an external computer. The
device was calibrated to diffuse at three diffusion rates: no diffusion, low and high. For each
level, the quantity of delivered odor was precisely characterized using a repeated weighting
method. The corresponding perceived olfactory intensities were evaluated by a
psychophysical experiment on sixteen participants. Results demonstrated the device
capability to successfully create three significantly different perceived odor intensities
(Friedman test ùëù < 10‚àí6, Wilcoxon tests ùëùùëéùëë ùëó < 10‚àí3), without noticeable smell persistence
and with limited noise and discomfort. For reproducibility and to stimulate further research
in the area, 3D printing files, electronic hardware schemes, and firmware/software source
code are made publicly available.

#### 14h40 : Influence of the visual quality of food on the ability to induce a desire to eat in virtual reality (Florian RAMOUSSE ‚Äì ECL/ENISE, LIRIS)

Studies into food-related behaviors and emotions are increasingly being explored with
Virtual Reality (VR). Applications of VR technologies for food science include eating disorder
therapies, eating behavior studies and sensory analyzes. These applications involve 3D
food stimuli intended to elicit cravings, stress, and/or emotions. However, the visual quality
(i.e., the realism) of used food stimuli is heterogeneous, and this factor's influence on the
results has never been isolated and evaluated. In this context, this work aims to study how
the visual quality of food stimuli, exposed in a virtual reality environment, influences the
resulting desire to eat. 28 subjects without eating disorders were included in this protocol,
who evaluated the desire to eat induced by 10 3D food stimuli, each duplicated in 7 quality
levels (for a total of 70 stimuli). Results show that visual quality influences the desire to eat,
and this effect depends on the type of food and users' eating habits. We found two significant
thresholds for visual quality: the first provides the minimal quality necessary to elicit a
significant desire to eat, while the second provides the ceiling value above which increasing
the quality does not improve further the desire to eat. These results allow us to provide useful
recommendations for the design of experiments involving food stimuli

#### 15h10 : Saisie de donn√©es par √©criture manuelle pour les applications industrielles de la r√©alit√© virtuelle : influence de l‚Äôorientation du tableau et des retours sensoriels sur la performance (Nicolas FOURRIER ‚Äì ECN, AAU)

La saisie de donn√©es textuelles en r√©alit√© virtuelle (RV) est une t√¢che critique dont
l‚Äôimportance ne cesse de grandir. C‚Äôest en particulier le cas pour les applications
industrielles de la RV o√π les situations de saisie de donn√©es peuvent √™tre courantes :
communication entre collaborateurs, saisie de donn√©es techniques... Il existe aujourd‚Äôhui
un gap de performance entre les outils classiques, comme les claviers physiques, et les
m√©thodes de saisie virtuelles qui sont utilis√©es en RV. La saisie de donn√©es en RV se doit
d‚Äô√™tre efficace et facile √† apprendre sans √™tre frustrante. Nous pr√©sentons une m√©thode de
saisie de texte bas√©e sur la reconnaissance d‚Äô√©criture manuelle qui r√©pond √† ces trois
crit√®res. Les utilisateurs peuvent saisir du texte en √©crivant manuellement sur un tableau
virtuel. Une √©tude utilisateur avec 40 participants a √©t√© men√©e pour √©tudier les meilleurs
conditions d‚Äô√©criture en terme d‚Äôorientation de tableau et de pr√©sence de retours sensoriels
(visuel, haptique et audio). La vitesse d‚Äô√©criture, le taux d‚Äôerreur, l‚Äôutilisabilit√© et la charge de
travail sont √©tudi√©s. Cette √©tude montre que l‚Äôutilisation d‚Äôun tableau pench√© avec des
retours sensoriels permet de maximiser les vitesses de saisie en minimisant la charge de
travail. L‚Äô√©criture manuelle en RV fait preuve d‚Äôune grande vitesse de saisie et utilisabilit√©
apr√®s un court entrainement en comparaison avec d‚Äôautres m√©thodes de saisie virtuelles.
Apr√®s 40 phrases d‚Äôentrainement, les participants atteignent en moyenne une vitesse de
saisie de 14.5 mots par minute et un groupe d‚Äôutilisateurs exp√©riment√©s en RV atteint 16.16
mots par minute. La plus haute vitesse de saisie observ√©e est de 21.11 mots par minute.

#### 16H10 : L'effet Proteus et la cr√©ativit√© avec l'incarnation de Leonardo da Vinci (Geoffrey GORISSE ‚Äì ENSAM, LAMPA)

Virtual reality provides users with the ability to substitute their physical appearance by em-
bodying virtual characters (avatars) using head-mounted displays and motion-capture tech-
nologies. Previous research demonstrated that the sense of embodiment toward an avatar
can impact user behavior and cognition. In this paper, we present an experiment designed
to investigate whether embodying a well-known creative genius could enhance participants'
creative performance. Following a preliminary online survey (N = 157) to select a famous
character suited to the purpose of this study, we developed a VR application allowing parti-
cipants to embody Leonardo da Vinci or a self-avatar. Self-avatars were approximately
matched with participants in terms of skin tone and morphology. 40 participants took part in
three tasks seamlessly integrated in a virtual workshop. The first task was based on a Guil-
ford's Alternate Uses test (GAU) to assess participants' divergent abilities in terms of fluency
and originality. The second task was based on a Remote Associates Test (RAT) to evaluate
convergent abilities. Lastly, the third task consisted in designing potential alternative uses
of an object displayed in the virtual environment using a 3D sketching tool. Participants em-
bodying Leonardo da Vinci demonstrated significantly higher divergent thinking abilities, with
a substantial difference in fluency between the groups. Conversely, participants embodying
a self-avatar performed significantly better in the convergent thinking task. Taken together,
these results promote the use of our virtual embodiment approach, especially in applications
where divergent creativity plays an important role, such as design and innovation.

#### 16h40 Influence of Scenarios and Player Traits on Flow in Virtual Reality (√âlise LAVOU√â ‚Äì Universit√© Jean Moulin Lyon 3, LIRIS)

Many studies have investigated how interpersonal differences between users influence their
experience in Virtual Reality (VR) and it is now well recognized that user's subjective
experiences and responses to the same VR environment can vary widely. In this study, we
focus on player traits, which correspond to users' preferences for game mechanics, arguing
that players react differently when experiencing VR scenarios. We developed three
scenarios in a same VR environment that rely on different game mechanics and evaluate
the influence of player traits on users‚Äô perceived flow in each scenario. Our results show 
that 1) the type of scenario has an impact on specific dimensions of flow; 2) the scenarios have
different effects on flow depending on the order they are performed, the flow preconditions
being stronger when performed at last; 3) almost all dimensions of flow are influenced by
the player traits, these influences depending on the scenario, 4) the Aesthetic trait has the
most influences in the three scenarios. We finally discuss the findings and limitations of the
present study that we believe has strong implications for the design of scenarios in VR
experiences.
