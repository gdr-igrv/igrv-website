**Expected Outcome**: Projects are expected to contribute to
the following outcomes:

-   Next generation of XR devices and applications, by exploiting cross
    fertilisation between technologies such as 5G/6G, IoT, data,
    artificial intelligence, edge and cloud computing, and
    microelectronics but also across domains of use such as (but not
    limited to education, manufacturing, health, cultural heritage,
    media and security).

-   More realistic, more affordable and gender-neutral devices and
    applications, developed by European companies, respecting European
    values of ethics, privacy, security and safety, aiming at
    technological sovereignty and resilience.

**Scope**: The following two types of research and innovation
proposals are expected:

i.  The development and integration of advanced XR hardware components,
    such as displays, optics and sensors, for a new generation of XR
    devices providing greater visual, wearable, vestibular and social
    comfort. Special relevance should be given (a) to technological
    breakthroughs in photonics and new materials aiming to increase the
    image quality and to reduce the size and weight of XR devices; (b)
    to displays and optical elements bringing the capabilities of XR
    devices closer to those of the human vision; (c) to more efficient
    architectures for enhanced performance, reduced power consumption
    and improved heat dissipation; (d) to novel systems that cater to
    the widest range of users, including those that need prescription
    correction; (e) to advanced optical- and photo-detector technologies
    for sensing systems, including sensing data processing; (f) to
    innovative XR connectivity components supporting the demanding
    requirements on latency, data rates and resilience; and (g) to novel
    materials with tailored optical, mechanical and processing
    properties for a tight integration of subcomponents, enabling
    overall miniaturization and environmentally sustainable
    mass-production of future XR devices.

At least one proposal of this type will be funded.

i.  The development of new solutions aiming to improve the user
    experience, skills and capacity in social and professional XR
    setups. This includes tools and services for the creation and
    management of interactive virtual worlds and 3D models, realistic
    full body avatars and intelligent agents. The solutions will also
    seek to enhance the interoperability, performance and accessibility
    of XR experiences. The proposals will include prototypes validated
    in realistic scenarios, proving how innovative the developed
    solutions are, how they exploit synergies between disciplines and
    domains, and how far beyond state of the art they go.

At least one proposal of this type will be funded.

The Commission considers that proposals with an overall duration of
typically 36 months would allow these outcomes to be addressed
appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and
selection of proposals requesting other durations.

This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and
the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of
relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant
effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities

**Expected Outcome**: Projects are expected to contribute to
the following outcomes:

-   Develop "XR made in Europe", contributing to technological
    sovereignty.

-   Contribute to develop virtual worlds European platforms.

-   Support the use of XR technologies for a sustainable, human-centric
    and resilient European industry[^1].

**Scope**: The following two types of innovation proposals are
expected.

-   i\. The development of XR applications to support companies in all
    industrial ecosystems, especially SMEs, to use innovative
    interactive and immersive technologies, increasing their
    competitiveness, productivity, efficiency and human-centricity. The
    applications should be robust, gender-neutral safe and trustworthy,
    especially in terms of cybersecurity, privacy and health issues.
    Proposals should exploit cross fertilisation between academics,
    industry representatives and end-users around well thought-out
    scenarios. Moreover, proposals should include activities to showcase
    the results, widely disseminating and exploiting the outcomes.

-   ii\. The creation of a European reference platform aiming to develop
    and prototype advanced interoperable XR solutions to solve common
    challenges encountered by the industry (in areas such as assembly,
    maintenance, remote operation, training, design, logistics, etc.),
    placing the wellbeing of workers at the centre of the production
    process. The platform will be populated with third party-projects
    exploring a wide range of XR technologies and taking benefit of
    other emerging technologies (such as 5G/6G, IoT, data, artificial
    intelligence, edge and cloud computing, and microelectronics). In
    order to facilitate the integration with existing IT systems and
    policies, the EU XR platform for industry should prioritize XR
    content, tools and solutions based on open standards, such as OpenXR
    and WebXR. The solutions provided by the platform should aim to
    cover as many industry ecosystems as possible. Involvement of
    end-users is essential in defining specifications and testing.

At least one proposal will be funded for the innovation type i.

Only one proposal will be funded for innovation type ii.

**Financial support to third parties**

The type ii innovation action will provide financial support third-party
projects from outstanding XR innovators, SMEs and other
multidisciplinary actors through a minimum of three open calls during
the lifetime of the project.

The consortium will define a coherent and coordinated programme logic
for the third-party projects, offering the necessary technical support,
coaching and mentoring, to ensure a significant advancement and impact
in the innovation domain, including in terms of interoperability and
standardisation. These tasks cannot be implemented using the budget
earmarked for the financial support to third parties.

Proposals should make explicit the intervention logic for the area and
their potential to attract relevant top XR talents and to deliver a
solid value-added to the third-party projects. Proposals should also
prove the expertise and capacity of the consortium in managing the full
life-cycle of the open calls transparently and efficiently.

As support and mobilising of XR innovators is key to the type ii IA of
this topic, a minimum of 60% of the total requested EU contribution
should be allocated to financial support to the third parties.

The Commission considers that proposals with an overall duration of
typically 36 months would allow these outcomes to be addressed
appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and
selection of proposals requesting other durations.

For ensuring focused effort, third parties in type ii will be funded
through projects typically in the EUR 250 000 to 500 000 range per
project, with indicative duration of 12 to 15 months.

This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and
the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of
relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant
effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research
activities.

**Expected Outcome**: Proposal results are expected to
contribute to one of the following expected outcomes:

-   Innovative AI solutions for trusted information production for media
    professionals.

Innovative AI solutions for supporting trustworthy online activity of
citizens.

**Scope**: Following the results of the first HE work
programme, the second work programme will support innovation activities
to move closer to AI-based market and ultimately widely available
solutions that can play an important role in ensuring pluralistic access
to meaningful information, quality content and trustworthy online
interaction. This topic is fully in line with both the EDAP -- European
Democracy Action Plan and MAAP -- Media and Audiovisual Action Plan, for
reinforcing the European media ecosystem and maintaining resilient
democratic systems, in times of crises and of need for adaptation and
change.

Given the emergence of the next generation of social media as part of
digital universe(s) or fediverse(s), which are more immersive and based
on virtual realities and gaming contexts, the detection of different
forms of content manipulation (e.g. deep-fakes, tampered content and
scammed environments) becomes even more challenging. Solutions provided
would include the correlation/comparison of various sources of
information, multi-modal language interpretation, rapid visual pattern
detection in moving images and simulated environments, capabilities as
recommendation engine/personal companion, and interfacing with
augmented, virtual reality and gaming environments. Solutions should be
gender-sensitive and not perpetuate harmful stereotypes. The innovation
actions will bring together technological providers, media professionals
and end users for ensuring market readiness of the results.

Proposals should clearly identify the expected outcome it will focus on
(i.e. media professionals or citizens). All proposals are expected to
embed mechanisms to assess and demonstrate progress (with qualitative
and quantitative KPIs, demonstrators, benchmarking and progress
monitoring), and share communicable results with the European R&D
community, through the AI-on-demand platform. Activities are expected to
achieve TRL6-7 by the end of the project.

All proposals are expected to allocate tasks to cohesion activities with
the other subtopic, the PPP on AI, Data and Robotics and funded actions
related to this partnership, and to extend and apply the results from
the previous research and innovation topic on AI against Disinformation.

**Expected Outcome**: This call encourages a mind change
regarding the role of the arts in R&I in the spirit of a European
innovation policy based on culture and values. It is building on results
of the [S|T|ARTS program](https://starts.eu/) that has
demonstrated concrete benefits of art-technology collaboration for
digital innovation and uptake of digital in society and economy.

1.  a.  *Facilitate artistic experimentation with (digital)
        technologies* to accelerate development and novel
        use cases of digital technologies. The emphasise will be on
        ecologically conscious and human compatible technologies and use
        case of technologies.

To this end, the consortium will fund (via FSTP in form of grants)
*S|T|ARTS residencies* of artists to be hosted by EC funded
projects, technology institutions, or SMEs/industrial actors (both
digital providers and end-users of digital). In the spirit of the topic,
hosts of residencies must provide access to technology free of cost. The
consortium will mentor residencies and help in follow-up/exploitation of
the outcomes (commercial or other). Non-exclusive examples of intended
outcomes include:

-   Art-driven development and use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in
    spirit of the EC communication on '*Trustworthy AI'*

-   Art-driven applications of high-performance computing
    (visualisation, simulation etc).

-   Art as a catalyst for uptake of the digital in society and economy
    in the spirit of [digital innovation
    hubs](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/edihs).

-   Art-driven use of technology to facilitate the Green Transition, in
    the spirt of the '*New European Bauhaus'* (urban development, green
    manufacturing, circular economy, etc.)

-   Art-driven use of digital media to fight disinformation, for example
    to promote factual narratives and change behavior in context of
    Green Transition and climate change.

    a.  *Continuation of the annual S|T|ARTS prize*: Achieve
        visibility of successful art and technology collaborations via
        an annual prize (FSTP in form of prizes) in two categories - to
        be defined by proposers, organize annual calls (launch,
        evaluation) and disseminate the prizes and its winners in an
        award ceremony and an exhibition.

    b.  Organise an *annual S|T|ARTS Festival*. The festival
        will highlight synergies of digital -- in particular AI - with
        human creativity in art and music. Artistic use of digital can
        push limits of digital technology and is considered a measure of
        compatibility of digital with human values and needs.

**Scope**: While Europe is strongly pushing innovation based
on technological and scientific progress, it has always put social and
ecological priorities on the same level as economic growth. This has led
to a new alliance of the arts with S&T as part of a European innovation
policy rooted in values and culture. Artists become key drivers of
'art-driven innovation' towards *ecologically conscious and human
compatible technologies*. In this spirit, DG CONNECT
launched [S|T|ARTS](https://starts.eu/) - innovation at
the nexus of Science, Technology and the ARTS -- and the European
Commission president proposed the '*New European Bauhaus',* where
synergies between art and novel technologies are identified as enablers
of the Green Transition. The present call will thus encourage actors in
R&I to adopt artistic experimentation as a complementary method of
technology development and use across all of the EC programs.

The Commission considers a duration of 36 months as appropriate.

### HORIZON-CL4-2024-HUMAN-01-02: Collaborative intelligence -- combining the best of machine and human (AI Data and Robotics Partnership) {#horizon-cl4-2024-human-01-02-collaborative-intelligence-combining-the-best-of-machine-and-human-ai-data-and-robotics-partnership .HeadingThree}

**Expected Outcome**: Projects are expected to contribute to
the following outcomes:

-   Advancement of human-machine interaction - general advancements in
    human-computer interaction, operational for a broad range of
    AI-reasoning systems and applicable to a broad range of application
    areas of AI.

-   Improved human decision-making and analytic abilities - Demonstrate
    that collaborative decision-making improves over human
    decision-making and that the collaborative decisions cover all
    stages of reasoning (that they are based on an improved coverage of
    data and knowledge sources, on an improved analytic ability to
    reason from input to output, and on a well-communicated decision).

-   Demonstrate the value of collaborative decision making by improved
    effectiveness, efficiency, completeness, limits of knowledge
    indication and other objective or quantifiable subjective measures.

**Scope**: The R&I priorities require work at different
levels, including both foundational research and well-studied piloting
efforts, concentrated in impactful projects, bringing critical mass of
expertise and investment to demonstrate potential for more than one
major application sectors respectively.

Research should focus on:

-   foundational research towards the next generation of collaborative
    AI, bringing excellence, critical mass and novel approaches as well
    as quantitatively proven improvement in the levels of human-machine
    collaboration.

-   simulations and experimentation (with and without humans in the
    loop) to explore the consequences of different interventions and/or
    to explore the design approaches that help manage decision making.

-   integrating advances from \[effective, efficient, anticipative,
    multi-modal\] human-computer interaction and from \[incremental,
    continually learned, or anticipative\], automatic reasoning systems
    in order to create new generations of collaborative AI-systems that
    better and more naturally serve human needs. The means of
    collaboration can cover the whole range of multi-modal stimuli:
    lingual, image, video, sound and other forms of interaction,
    whatever is arguably the most appropriate in the interaction
    process.

Multidisciplinary research activities should address all of the
following:

-   Proposals should involve appropriate expertise in Social Sciences
    and Humanities (SSH)

-   Research should build on existing standards or contribute to
    standardisation. Interoperability for data sharing should be
    addressed.

-   Projects should build on or seek collaboration with existing
    projects and develop synergies with other relevant European,
    national or regional initiatives, funding programmes and platforms.

-   Contribute to making AI and robotics solutions meet the requirements
    of Trustworthy AI, based on the respect of the ethical principles,
    the fundamental rights including critical aspects such as
    robustness, safety, reliability, in line with the European

Approach to AI. Ethics principles needs to be adopted from early stages
of development and design.

All proposals are expected to embed mechanisms to assess and demonstrate
progress (with qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking and
progress monitoring, as well as illustrative application use-cases
demonstrating concrete potential added value), and share communicable
results with the European R&D community, through the AI-on-demand
platform or Digital Industrial Platform for Robotics, public community
resources, to maximise re-use of results, either by developers, or for
uptake, and optimise efficiency of funding; enhancing the European AI,
Data and Robotics ecosystem through the sharing of results and best
practice.

**Expected Outcome**: Projects should contribute to all of the
following expected outcomes:

-   Cultural heritage professionals in Europe, including curators,
    conservators and researchers of cultural heritage, use a common set
    of new innovative tools and methods for the digitisation and
    visualisation of cultural heritage objects (3D and enhanced 2D) with
    regard to their visible and non-visible properties and
    characteristics, which are accessible through and connected to the
    European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage (ECCCH).

-   The European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage (ECCCH)
    provides cultural heritage institutions and professionals with
    enhanced technological and methodological capabilities to study
    cultural heritage objects, to share related data of their visible
    and non-visible properties and characteristics, and to develop new
    forms of collaboration.

**Scope**: This topic aims at designing and implementing
innovative tools and methods for digitisation of (a) visible
characteristics and (b) non-visible characteristics of cultural heritage
objects, to be incorporated into the European Collaborative Cloud for
Cultural Heritage (ECCCH).

As regards digitisation of visible characteristics of cultural heritage
objects, technologies are now satisfying the needs for a considerable
part of uses and objects. For instance, in the field of digital
documentation of cultural heritage, three-dimensional acquisition and
reconstruction methods have been developed in the past twenty years,
using photogrammetry and laser scanning techniques to capture the
characteristics of physical cultural heritage objects. Such methods
already provide robust solutions for the digital reconstruction of the
geometry and visual appearance of object surfaces. In addition to these
methods, in the field of cultural heritage conservation various
non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques have become important technical
and scientific means of examination. Such techniques allow understanding
the phenomena of deterioration and defining the restoration,
conservation and documentation needs of cultural heritage objects.

Nevertheless, there are still major needs in cultural heritage that
require further research and innovation on more advanced digitisation
tools and methods:

-   New AI-powered tools and methods that improve the digitisation
    process of tangible cultural heritage objects. The robustness and
    efficiency of the 3D digitisation process should be improved,
    especially in the case of massive digitisation (for example
    collections of objects). The accuracy and completeness of surface
    appearance acquisition should also be improved, as well as the
    mapping of complex reflectance data on digital surfaces.
    Furthermore, such solutions should yield new improved methods for
    post-processing and cleaning of the 3D models produced.

-   Improved methods for acquiring and processing enhanced 2D
    representations (e.g. reflectance transformation imaging,
    multispectral, panoramic), and for better integrating 2D
    representations with 3D representations.

-   Future 3D models need to encode other key attributes in addition to
    the usual geometric and reflectance data, such as local uncertainty
    information. New tools and methods are therefore needed to calculate
    and encode local accuracy limits with high precision in
    reconstructed 3D models. These tools should be capable of producing
    measurement-based limits of the similarity between the digital model
    and the physical object at any surface point, as well as
    algorithmically estimated accuracy boundaries.

-   To model a complex assembly is a costly effort, and today often
    requires dismounting the assembly - which is often not possible.
    Specific digitisation solutions should be developed that are capable
    of mixing various digitisation approaches (e.g. scanning and
    computer tomography scans) in order to capture dynamic or hidden
    characteristics of complex assemblies without dismounting them.[^7]

As regards the study of non-visible characteristics of complex objects,
nowadays different techniques are used, e.g. multispectral imaging,
X-rays, infrared reflectance, terahertz imaging, etc. Proposals should
focus on innovations at the data acquisition level, with a view to
improve the quality and usability of the data generated. An important
aspect is the robustness, reliability as well as the ease of use of any
tool and method for analysing the visible characteristics and
non-visible materials properties of cultural heritage objects under real
world conditions. In addition, several recent experimental approaches
have shown that multimodal analysis techniques should include a temporal
dimension, observing the evolution of features and phenomena over time.

These challenges highlight the need for flexible, transferable, and
simple solutions for documenting multimodal analyses. These solutions
should include the integration of data acquisitions from different
technologies into complex data structures that provide new analysis
opportunities for conservation scientists, conservators and curators.
This requires the introduction of new visualisation tools that act as
virtual environments for scientific exploration, allowing scientists and
curators to explore the full material complexity of cultural heritage
objects beyond what is visible.

Large datasets are often generated (e.g., many dozens of images in the
case of hyperspectral imaging). To address this, new AI solutions should
be developed to generate classified or pre-analysed data, enabling the
selection and/or identification of specific elements, images or regions
of interest that exhibit important differences for subsequent analysis
and validation by the human expert.

The tools and methods introduced should focus on geometric and
projective consistency of heterogeneous data from different
technologies, with respect to different scales of observation and
analysis, over a wide spectral range, to produce an integrated digital
representation. Spatially localised characterisation of individual
material layers is one of the goals, including coupling multi- or
hyperspectral analyses with physicochemical characterisation of
materials. New methods for access, exploration, and temporal monitoring
of acquired data should be developed, including their interactive
visualisation and classification.

The proposed software tools and methods to be developed should go beyond
the lab prototype status, should be practical and possible to deploy
easily in un-controlled environments (e.g. digitise in a museum room),
and should ensure low cost and flexibility of use. The component for
data integration into the ECCCH may extend the features of the basic
tool developed by the project funded under topic
HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01, with the goal of streamlining the
upload of metadata/paradata and of raw sampled data.

The proposals should demonstrate the potential of the developed tools
and methods through representative case studies, conducted in
collaboration with relevant stakeholders. These case studies should
cover a significant share of the range of cultural heritage objects,
materials and conservation/restoration issues. The results of these case
studies should produce emblematic data that can serve as models for
promoting the re-use of the tool(s) and methods in other contexts and by
other users within the ECCCH.

The proposed tool(s) to be developed should be implemented adopting the
low-level libraries established by the project funded under topic
HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. The tool(s) developed should be
compliant with the design of the ECCCH, and should be integrated with
the ECCCH before the end of the project, together with proper
documentation. All software and other related deliverables should be
compliant with the data model and the software development guidelines
elaborated by the project funded under topic
'HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01'.

The proposals should furthermore make provisions to actively participate
in the common activities of ECCCH initiative. In particular, the
proposals should coordinate technical work with other selected projects
and contribute to the activities of the project funded under the topic
HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01.

The proposals should set up its project website under the common ECCCH
website, managed by the project funded under topic
HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. The proposal is further expected
to include a budget for the attendance to regular joint coordination
meetings and may consider to cover the costs of any other joint
activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities
at this stage.

**Expected Outcome**: Projects should contribute to all of the
following expected outcomes:

-   Established guiding principles based on human rights and European
    values on how to approach long term future opportunities and
    challenges posed by artificial intelligence and related
    technologies.

-   Structurally enhanced capacities to foresee, evaluate and manage the
    long term opportunities and challenges associated with artificial
    intelligence and related technologies.

-   Well founded and prioritised recommendations for European policy on
    R&I and in other key areas aimed at :

    -   Ensuring that Europe is prepared to exploit the opportunities
        for the benefit of citizens and society, and at the same time
        face the challenges raised by potential developments and
        deployments of artificial intelligence and related technologies
        based on science and evidence as well as human rights and
        European values, and

    -   Reinforcing Europe's capacity to guide the development and
        deployment of these technologies in ways aligned to human rights
        and European values.

**Scope**: The history of "artificial intelligence"
technologies (AI) is marked by great optimism and expectation, sometimes
followed by disappointment. However, we have recently seen a sustained
upsurge in interest and the successful uptake and application of AI in a
variety of significant areas such as drug discovery, autonomous
vehicles, social media, industrial robotics, and logistics, to name a
few. We have witnessed significant successes in the development and
deployment of machine learning, particularly for tasks normally
associated with human perception[^8]. We have also seen significant
successes in symbolic and logic-driven AI for problems that require
reasoning about constraints, automated reasoning, planning, etc.[^9] AI
has had significant impact in the arts and humanities, and AI-based
methods and tools are becoming more widely used in the cultural
arena.[^10]

Nevertheless, today the collection of computer technologies commonly
labelled artificial intelligence, along with related technologies for
instance in the fields of data science, neuroscience and biotechnology,
already show the potential to disrupt and impact the rights of
individuals and the wellbeing of societal structures. For example, there
have been many documented case studies where AI-based applications have
exhibited undesired gender and racial bias[^11]. AI systems have been
(mis-)used to micro-target and influence voters in elections as well as
in the creation and dissemination of disinformation[^12], and otherwise
impact on human agency and autonomy. Many ethical issues arise in the
development of AI systems, such as their use in medical devices,
brain-computer interfaces, reasoning about human mental and emotion
state, etc.[^13]

Concerns are often raised that AI technologies may imply major societal
disruptions such as massive job displacements due to the increasing use
of AI-drive automation and robotics, while research show that AI can
also help filling gaps in workforce[^14][^15].

In 2018, the European Commission established the High Level Expert Group
on Artificial Intelligence (HLEG-AI), which was tasked with developing a
set of ethics guidelines for Europe that would help ensure that AI
systems be human-centric and trustworthy. The importance of a
human-centric approach to AI has been a cornerstone of EU policy-making
in the field for several years and is the clearly articulated position
of the EU. The European Commission published a pioneering draft AI Act
in April 2021, the first legal framework on AI in Europe, which
addresses the potential risks of using AI[^16]. The Horizon Europe work
programme under Cluster 4 is funding related research and innovation
actions under the header 'Leadership in AI based on trust'.

The common principle across all of these EU initiatives are seven key
requirements for trustworthy AI[^17], as proposed by the HLEG-AI and
adopted by the European Commission, as well as the importance of
protecting the fundamental rights of individuals[^18].

Against this backdrop, before being faced with a 'fait-accompli' in
terms of potentially undesirable influence of AI on the European society
and economy and to make sure that all the beneficial potential of AI
deployment is fully realised, we should anticipate and prepare for
possible and high impact scenarios.

The proposal should cover all the following aspects:

-   Decisive contributions to develop a sound European capacity building
    on the long term human and societal implications of AI, building, as
    appropriate, on previous work of the HLEG-AI, ADRA[^19], or other
    relevant European and national AI initiatives.

-   A solid scientific approach, providing an in-depth analysis of
    successful existing deployment of AI and the impact they have on
    European economy and society. Such analysis should also
    significantly contribute to awareness raising of such deployments,
    providing a reality check of capabilities/benefits, but also
    limitations of current AI solutions, and how the latter are
    currently addressed.

-   Scenario based analysis of future long term potential benefits to
    citizens and societies, as well as an analysis of related challenges
    and threats.

-   Based on this, proposals should elaborate a set of guiding
    principles, ensuring a broad support and appropriate involvement of
    other relevant AI initiatives.

-   Proposals need to take a multi-disciplinary and cross-sectorial
    approach, and engage with a wide set of stakeholders, including
    research organisations, enterprises, citizens[^20], policymakers,
    public private partnerships such as the AI, Data and Robotics
    Partnership, and other relevant EU projects and initiatives around
    AI.

-   European policy actions should be proposed in a priority order,
    notably in the area of research and innovation but not excluding
    other important policy areas, that would serve to strengthen
    European preparedness and resilience in the face of future
    developments within AI and related emerging technologies as well as
    to guide the development and deployment of these technologies in a
    desirable direction.

Proposals should build on existing knowledge, activities and networks,
such as the HLEG-AI and other initiatives funded by the European Union.
Funded proposals should also take into account existing EU policy in the
area, such as Excellence and trust in artificial intelligence under A
Europe fit for the digital age[^21]. Furthermore, the proposals should
seek synergies with closely related actions, such as relevant R&I
actions funded by Horizon Europe or Horizon 2020[^22].

**Expected Outcome**: Project results are expected to
contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

-   Reduction of construction and renovation time on-site (at least 40%
    reduction).

-   Reduction of errors in construction and renovation works.

-   Improved resource efficiency.

-   Reduction of construction and renovation costs.

-   Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from, and improved
    energy efficiency of the works on-site.

-   Reduced environmental impact of construction works, including
    pollution, particulate matter[^23] and noise, in the immediate
    vicinity.

-   Reduction of waste generated from the works on-site.

**Scope**: The transformation of the built environment should
take place in a way that minimises the environmental impact of the works
themselves. With the increasing rollout of highly energy efficient,
sustainable buildings and deep renovation, there is a growing need for
the development of robotic and automated solutions to support
sustainable building construction, renovation and maintenance processes
that are less disruptive, cleaner and faster.

Proposals are expected to address all of the following:

-   Investigate the use of robotic systems (including those used for 3D
    printing) and automation for construction and deep renovation, in
    order to reduce time of construction and renovation works, reduce
    construction errors, as well as facilitate maintenance, also
    minimising the impact of the works on the surrounding built
    environment.

-   Explore the potential for lower construction costs through
    automation and robotics resulting from increased speed, improved
    resource efficiency and avoidance of errors.

-   Develop robotic and automated design and construction techniques
    that increase energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions
    from construction and renovation works on-site.

-   Develop approaches that use digitally assisted design to improve
    resource efficiency and safety, reduce waste, and reduce
    construction time.

-   Investigate the use of automated technologies for surveying,
    inspection and monitoring of the site.

-   Investigate the use of automated support to augment workers'
    capability and safety (e.g., lift robots, exoskeletons, automated
    construction site monitoring, use of augmented and virtual reality).

-   Test and validate the prototyped solutions in at least three
    prototypes to assess the proposed approaches for a variety of
    buildings typologies representative of the European building stock.
    These prototypes should be validated in a lab or another relevant
    environment. The testing and validation are expected to address both
    new construction and renovation.

-   Contribute to the activities of the Built4People partners and to the
    Built4People network of innovation clusters.

This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on
'People-centric sustainable built environment' (Built4People). As such,
projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results
to the European Partnership 'People-centric sustainable built
environment' (Built4People) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.

Expected outcome:

In line with the farm to fork strategy, the Common Agricultural Policy
post 2022, and the Headline ambition of a Digital Age, a successful
proposal will contribute to transition to a fair, healthy and resilient
agriculture. It will therefore also directly and/ or indirectly
contribute to the enhancement of the sustainability performance of the
sector, including social sustainability, and competitiveness in
agriculture through research and innovation which will support the
further deployment of digital and data technologies as key enablers.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following
expected outcomes:

-   Enhanced working conditions in agriculture (including increased
    safety of workers and reduced drudgery) through innovative digital
    solutions exploiting the potential of augmented reality.

-   Lowered environmental impacts and productions costs and increased
    product quality in and through the use of digital technologies,
    through robotics and augmented reality in particular.

-   Reduced the share of risky or unattractive actions/tasks to be
    performed by workers through automation-base solutions.

-   Mitigated lack/ shortage of work force in agriculture in some
    through automation-based solutions.

Scope:

Digital and data technologies can facilitate the work in agriculture,
enhance working conditions[^24] and mitigate the challenge of a lack of
work force, by which some branches and regions are affected. They have
the potential of making farm-related jobs more attractive, including for
younger generations, and to make them safer. Digital and data
technologies can increase the effectiveness and efficiency of
applications, including for instance through a higher level of
precision, and thus increase the sustainability and competitiveness of
the sector. Automation is increasingly used in agriculture; frequently,
the cost-effectiveness of innovative digital and data technologies still
presents a bottleneck to their use in the sector, particular in fields
where their application is not primarily relevant for increasing process
efficiency and effective. Technical solutions based on augmented reality
approaches offer many opportunities to facilitate and enhance the use of
digital technologies in agriculture, to enhance the performance of
digital tools, and to provide remote assistance, which is important for
remote businesses.

Proposals should address the following:

-   Development of augmented-reality based solutions to improve working
    conditions, safety and failure avoidance, and to further increase
    robotic performance.

-   Development of robotic solutions to improve unhealthy working
    conditions, where applicable. Robotics tasks to be fostered might be
    directly related to agricultural production, such as harvesting,
    weeding, crop monitoring, animal husbandry or indirectly related,
    such as logistics/ farm management.

-   Development of robotic solutions for tasks, for which there is a
    high interest/ need to support and/ or replace the human work force,
    not only because of an interest to improve productivity, but to
    ensure production in an environmentally and socially sustainable
    way.

-   Strengthening AI capabilities for agro-robotics in the fields of
    applications fostered by the proposals including through the use of
    (scalable) platforms to further increase robotics performance.

-   Development of business models for the use of the developed
    innovative technologies under consideration of various farm
    structures and inter-farm linkages as well as of various
    biogeographic and socio-economic framing conditions.

-   Development of a tool for system analyses of the consequences for
    farmers and rural communities of enhancing working conditions
    through automation and augmented reality and of replacing human work
    force with robotic systems.

The development of such technologies should take into account relevant
(forthcoming) legislation, in particular linked to the horizontal Act on
AI, the Liability Directive, and Machinery Directive/ Regulation.
Projects are encouraged - when reflecting on the effects of automation
and augmented reality - to dedicate particular attention to youth/
younger generation, women and persons with disabilities as well as to
the affordability of digital solutions. Projects are expected to develop
training material allowing the targeted end users and multipliers to
easily deploy and promote the new technologies.

Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach' including a range of
actors to ensure that knowledge and needs from various stakeholder
groups, including farmers, farm workers, farm advisors and scientists
are taken into consideration. This topic should involve the effective
contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines.

Projects are expected to take into consideration the results of other
related Horizon 2020/ Europe projects as well as of other relevant
EU-funded projects and initiatives.\
Proposals may involve financial support to third parties, e.g. to
academic researchers, hi-tech start-ups, SMEs, and other
multidisciplinary actors, to, for instance, develop, test or validate
developed approaches, tools and applications or to provide other
contributions to achieve the project objectives. A maximum of € 60 000
per third party might be granted. Conditions for third parties support
are set out in Part B of the General Annexes. Consortia need to define
